# JSS Blazor

![JSS Blazor](assets/jss-blazor-banner.svg)

JSS Blazor for [Sitecore JavaScript Services][1] allows you to build
full-featured websites on top of Sitecore, entirely in C#, using
[Blazor WebAssembly][2].

The aim of this project is to have feature parity with the existing Angular,
React, and Vue.js frameworks for [Sitecore JavaScript Services][1] so you can
build your sites without writing a bit of JavaScript! üòé

This repository consists of the JSS Blazor SDK, which can be found in the `/src`
folder, and a Styleguide sample site built using Helix principles found in the
`/samples` folder. The Styleguide sample site is built using all of the same
components and content found in the boilerplate projects for JSS Angular, React,
and Vue.js.
